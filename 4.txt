In Java, primitive data types are the basic types of data that are not objects. They include:

1. byte: 8-bit integer.
2. short: 16-bit integer.
3. int: 32-bit integer.
4. long: 64-bit integer.
5. float: 32-bit floating-point number.
6. double: 64-bit floating-point number.
7. char: 16-bit Unicode character.
8. boolean: Represents `true` or `false`.

These types are used for simple values and are more efficient than objects.
